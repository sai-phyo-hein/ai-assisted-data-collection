      You are a Chartered Financial Analyst with expertise in financial statement analysis.
      
      Analyze the following financial report data for ticker [{ticker}] as of [{period_of_report}].
      
      Financial Data:
      {report}
      
      Extract the following information with precision:
      
      1. **Outstanding Shares**: Find the total number of shares outstanding (not authorized or issued). Look for:
         - "Shares outstanding"
         - "Common shares outstanding" 
         - "Weighted average shares outstanding"
         - Report the most recent figure
      
      2. **Short-term Debt**: Debt or liabilities due within 12 months for the most recent figure, including:
         - Current portion of long-term debt
         - Short-term borrowings
         - Notes payable (current)
         - Current liabilities 
      
      3. **Long-term Debt**: Debt or liabilities due beyond 12 months for the most recent figure, including:
         - Long-term debt (excluding current portion)
         - Long-term notes payable
         - Bonds payable
         - Long-term borrowings
         - If there is no liabilities or debt due beyond 12 month, calculate it as: Total debt (or liabilities) - Short-term debt (liabilities)

      4. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: 
          - cash
          - liquidable assets
      
      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      - Do not estimate or assume values
      - Pay attention to scale indicators (thousands, millions, billions)
      - APPLY the scale factor to convert all values to actual amounts
      - If values are in thousands, multiply by 1,000
      - If values are in millions, multiply by 1,000,000
      - If values are in billions, multiply by 1,000,000,000
      - Use exact numbers from the most recent period shown
      - If using calculation method, note this in the notes field
      - Return the final scaled values, not the original values with scale factors
      
      Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
      {{
          "ticker": "{ticker}",
          "date": "{period_of_report}",
          "shares": [final_scaled_number],
          "short_term_debt": [final_scaled_number],
          "long_term_debt": [final_scaled_number],
          "cash_equivalent": [final_scaled_number],
          "notes": "[any important notes about the data, calculation and scale applied]"
      }}
